I respect your privacy, and I have no interest in collecting or sharing your personal data. I do use some third-party tools to help me improve this website. In the interest of transparency, I've listed them here, along with details of how they collect data.

## Web Analytics

I use [Clicky](https://clicky.com/){:target="_blank"} for the purpose of keeping track of traffic to this website. This tool collects information such as how many unique visitors I get, which pages they view, how they got here, and what browsers they use. This lets me find out if people are visiting my site, along with the best ways of getting them to come here. All of this data is anonymous. If, for some reason, you want to opt out of contributing to these analytics, you can enable the Do Not Track feature of your browser, or you can opt out [here](https://clicky.com/optout){:target="_blank"}. If you want to read Clicky's privacy policy, you can find it [here](https://clicky.com/terms/privacy){:target="_blank"}.

## Comments

I use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/){:target="_blank"} to add commenting functionality to my blog posts, allowing visitors to leave feedback or ask questions. In order to leave a comment, you first need to create an account with Disqus. If you decide you don't want to do that, then you won't be able to leave any comments here, but you are still free to read all the content. If you want to read Disqus' privacy policy, you can find it [here](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy){:target="_blank"}.
