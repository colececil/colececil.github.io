This is the second post of my blog. It's really not a real post. I'm just making it up for the purpose of showing it on the home page. You can stop reading this now. Really.

How about some code for good times' sake?

```javascript
function uselessCount () {
    var count = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        count++;
    }
    console.log(count);
}
```

And now let's try a table:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Value 1  | Value 2  |
| Value 3  | Value 4  |
| Value 5  | Value 6  |
