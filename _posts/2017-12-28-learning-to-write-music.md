I've been interested in the idea of composing music for quite a while, and being able to write music was the last thing I wasn't sure I'd be able to do in order to make a video game on my own. Over the summer, I finally decided to give it a try and see how it worked out. I wasn't sure if I could do it, but I figured it couldn't hurt to try.

After my first attempt at writing music, I was happy to find out I was able to do it! It's not as hard as I thought it might be, but it's still pretty tough sometimes. Here is my first attempt at writing a song:

I didn't learn much about music growing up, so my first step was to learn more about how music works. A few years ago, I read an introductory book on music theory. I believe it was [Music Theory for Computer Musicians](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6486885-music-theory-for-computer-musicians), if I remember correctly. It helped me a lot in understanding how music works and the building blocks that it's made of. I think this is around the time when I started thinking of trying to write music, but I didn't actually get to trying it for a few years. In the meantime, I just tried to think about music more as I listened to it, and I tried to figure out what made good music good.

Eventually, I came across [a free music making tutorial by Ableton](https://learningmusic.ableton.com). I went through it, and it's a really good interactive browser-based tutorial. It made composing music seem much more approachable to me, and it helped me to finally be motivated enough to try writing music. So far, I've been using a free DAW (digital audio workstation) called [LMMS](https://lmms.io) to compose music.

After I successfully wrote my first song, I decided to try writing a main menu theme for Bludgeon, the game I'm making. I was aiming for a medieval-sounding song. For this one, I actually came up with part of the melody in my head while doing the dishes one day. For most of the songs I've written so far, I didn't come up with a melody ahead of time, but kind of just came across one by putting random-ish notes in the DAW, and then adjusting them until I had something that sounded good. Here's the Bludgeon main menu theme I ended up writing:
