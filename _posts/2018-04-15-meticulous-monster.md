I just wanted to post a quick update to introduce [Meticulous Monster](https://meticulousmonster.com/){: target="_blank"} -- this is a company I created for the purpose of releasing Bludgeon once it's ready, along with any future games I decide to make. I actually created it early last year, but I'm announcing it now because I finally got [a website](https://meticulousmonster.com/){: target="_blank"} up for it!

In other news, Bludgeon is still coming along nicely -- and it has [its own web page](https://meticulousmonster.com/bludgeon){: target="_blank"} now! I had the opportunity to demo it at [EPX Con](https://epx.org.uiowa.edu/events/epx-con-animation-and-gaming-conference/){: target="_blank"}, an animation and gaming conference, yesterday. As always, I had a great time meeting people and seeing them enjoy the game.
