I've recently been working on updating the background art for Bludgeon. I've been using a very boring, plain, brick wall as the background during combat for quite a while. This was fine for initial versions of the game, but I really wanted to make something nicer. I decided to start out by making a dungeon, though I'm planning to eventually make several different levels to fight in.

Concept art:

Meanwhile, Kezia, my wife, draws beautiful pictures like this:
