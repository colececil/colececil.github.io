In this post, I want to share the story of a strange creature born from a bizarre alignment of white-knuckled fear, fatigue-fueled delirium, bullheaded creativity, a slightly-too-optimistic trust of technology, and yes - a camel-shaped snow drift. This is the story of Long Mary, a terrifying cryptid that captured my imagination (and my heart) last December.

## The Birth of a New Cryptid

This all started when my wife and I were driving to upstate New York to visit her family for Christmas. We were on the last leg of our journey - it was getting dark, and we were starting to get impatient for the drive to be over with. In an unfortunate turn of events, we realized a little too late that Google Maps had taken us onto some slightly terrifying back roads in the mountains of northern Pennsylvania, in the interest of "a faster route". (Note: It wasn't. Not by a long shot.) I'm sure this route would have been enjoyable had it not been for the ominous darkness of night and the pavement's occasional dusting of snow, but as it was, these conditions made the steep hills and the narrow, winding roads much more treacherous than was ideal. I remember obediently making my GPS-mandated turn onto one particularly perilous-looking stretch of road and stating aloud, "Welp, we're gonna die". (This behavior may have been influenced by the fact that I'd recently listened to [this harrowing story told by MrBallen](https://youtu.be/7G8f-AMx9-w). The story definitely crossed my mind.)

Anyway, at one point while we were navigating these hazardous roads, I noticed an unusual shape just off the road ahead, out of the corner of my eye. My first impression was that it was some strange, camel-shaped creature. On a closer inspection, it turned out to be a snow drift next to a mailbox. I laughed to myself and told my wife what I had seen. Soon after, we drove past a sign that read "Long Mary Road". Synapses fired, ideas formed, and the rest is cryptid history.

## Visualizing Long Mary - Artistic Process

During the subsequent week spent with family, I found that I couldn't get the idea out of my head. I found myself fixated on imagining what Long Mary might look like up close. I had recently been playing around with [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion), a machine learning model that can generate images from text prompts, and I thought it would be fun to try using it as part of the creative process. And what a convoluted process it ended up being!

### Step 1: Brainstorming

My first step was to just see what kinds of ideas Stable Diffusion could come up with. It took some time and experimentation, but I eventually came up with a prompt that seemed to give me pretty good results. They didn't have the level of quality I was looking for in the final image, but it was good enough to get some good ideas.

After generating many, many images, I selected some of my favorites, with the intention of incorporating elements of each of them into the final image. Here are the ones I selected:

As I mentioned, there were several prompt variations along the way, but here is one of its final iterations:

> Photo of a cryptid, extremely long neck, so many vertebrae, short stubby legs, ugly misshapen head, a single hump on its back, long crooked fangs, matted fur, its fur is covered in snow, sasquatch, chupacabra, mange, crouching, crawling, dark snowy forest, trees, horror, creepy, grotesque, little nightmares, slightly blurry photo, nature photography, dusk, ultra realistic

And here is the negative prompt that went with it:

> hand drawn, illustrated, out of frame, hand drawn, cartoon, unreal engine

### Step 2: Concept Sketch

### Step 3: Generation of Final Image

## A Twist: SCP Meets Long Mary

On sharing my creation with friends, the idea arose to generate an SCP-like entry for Long Mary. What's SCP, you ask? It's short for Secure, Contain, Protect - a creative writing project filled with user-created entries of supernatural creatures and events. With intrigue in my mind and technological help at my fingertips, I turned to ChatGPT. The result exceeded my expectations:

> Special Containment Procedures: Long Mary is to be contained within a standard Class-3 anomalous mammal containment unit at Site-17. The unit is to be designed to replicate the mountainous forest habitat of northern Pennsylvania, including a artificial snow feature for the creature's use. Access to the containment unit is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above, with Level 4 clearance required for any direct interaction with the specimen.
> 
> Long Mary is to be fed a diet of raw meat, supplemented with vitamins and minerals as necessary. Any attempts at domestication or training are strictly forbidden.
>
> Description: Long Mary is a cryptid mammal indigenous to the mountainous forests of northern Pennsylvania. It stands approximately 2 meters tall at the shoulder and 3 meters in length, with a weight of approximately 500 kg. It has a distinctive snow-covered hump on its back and a long neck, as well as a large head and sharp teeth. It is primarily white in color, with some grey and black markings on its face and legs.
>
> When crouched down, Long Mary bears a strong resemblance to a snow drift, with only its head and neck visible. This camouflage allows it to blend in with its surroundings and ambush prey. It is an apex predator in its habitat, with its diet consisting primarily of large mammals such as deer and elk.
>
> Long Mary has proven to be highly aggressive towards humans, with several reported attacks on hikers and hunters in the area. It is believed to be territorial and will attack any perceived threat to its territory.
>
> Research into Long Mary's anomalous properties is ongoing. It is currently unknown how the creature is able to maintain its snowy appearance year-round, as well as the potential use of its camouflage in other environments. Further study is required to fully understand the nature of this cryptid.

Wow! AI really delivered here, don't you think? Here's the original prompt I fed into the ChatGPT to generate this SCP entry:

> Imagine there is a cryptid that lives in the mountainous forests of northern Pennsylvania called Long Mary. It is a mammal that walks on four legs, and it has a snow-covered hump on its back. It has a long neck, along with a large head and a large mouth full of sharp teeth. When it crouches down, it looks like a snow drift with a post next to it. Please write an SCP entry about Long Mary. Feel free to embellish and make up new details about it.

## Parting Thoughts

Creating Long Mary was a wild ride. The inception through a series of random events, the iterative artistic process, and ultimately generating an SCP entry—each step was layered with learning. There's always room for improvement; the process can surely be optimized for efficiency. Regardless, I think we managed something unique here... almost as unique as a snow drift disguised as a camel.

I warmly invite your thoughts on Long Mary. Better yet, if you are inspired to invent your own cryptid, I'm intrigued to see your creations!

So, did our random roadside sighting lead us astray or on a rewarding detour? Would you stumble upon a cryptid the next time you see a strangely shaped snow drift? Well, truth be told, only time—and Google Maps' faster route—can tell.
