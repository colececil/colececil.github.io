In this post, I want to share a unique journey; a bizarre alignment of fate, improvisation, creativity, and a snow drift shaped like a camel. This is *the* story of how my wife and I stumbled upon our latest creation: a new cryptid, Long Mary. So, buckle up as we navigate from our inception story, through our artistic trials and tribulations, and end with an SCP-esque twist, all with a touch of humor and earnest reflection.

## The Birth of a New Cryptid

December last year, my wife and I were driving on some delightfully sketchy back roads in northern Pennsylvania, heading to visit her family for Christmas. Google Maps decided fun should be at the forefront of our drive, suggesting a "faster route". The fun (read: misdirection) really began when my eye caught an unusual shape. It looked like a camel lounging next to a mailbox. On a closer inspection, it turned out to be a snow drift. Soon after, we drove past a sign that read "Long Mary Road". Synapses fired, the idea was born, and the rest is, well...cryptid history.

## Visualizing Long Mary - Artistic Process

Next, it was time to translate our spectral camel, *Long Mary*, from imagination into reality. And what a convoluted, yet rewarding, process it was! I opted for Stable Diffusion to aid me in this task.

The platform provided me with image2image capabilities. Starting with a simple sketch—which was based off several initial images I created using Stable Diffusion prompts—I kept feeding results that caught my eye back into image2image until satisfaction hit.

Admittedly, this process is far from efficient. However, in the chaos came clarity; the picture in my mind was now on screen. Here are some of the original Stable Diffusion images that inspired my sketch:

So where does Long Mary reside, you ask? Here's the location on Google Maps that inspired our creation:

## A Twist: SCP Meets Long Mary

On sharing my creation with friends, the idea arose to generate an SCP-like entry for Long Mary. What's SCP, you ask? It's short for Secure, Contain, Protect - a creative writing project filled with user-created entries of supernatural creatures and events. With intrigue in my mind and technological help at my fingertips, I turned to ChatGPT. The result exceeded my expectations:

> Special Containment Procedures: Long Mary is to be contained within a standard Class-3 anomalous mammal containment unit at Site-17. The unit is to be designed to replicate the mountainous forest habitat of northern Pennsylvania, including a artificial snow feature for the creature's use. Access to the containment unit is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above, with Level 4 clearance required for any direct interaction with the specimen.
> 
> Long Mary is to be fed a diet of raw meat, supplemented with vitamins and minerals as necessary. Any attempts at domestication or training are strictly forbidden.
>
> Description: Long Mary is a cryptid mammal indigenous to the mountainous forests of northern Pennsylvania. It stands approximately 2 meters tall at the shoulder and 3 meters in length, with a weight of approximately 500 kg. It has a distinctive snow-covered hump on its back and a long neck, as well as a large head and sharp teeth. It is primarily white in color, with some grey and black markings on its face and legs.
>
> When crouched down, Long Mary bears a strong resemblance to a snow drift, with only its head and neck visible. This camouflage allows it to blend in with its surroundings and ambush prey. It is an apex predator in its habitat, with its diet consisting primarily of large mammals such as deer and elk.
>
> Long Mary has proven to be highly aggressive towards humans, with several reported attacks on hikers and hunters in the area. It is believed to be territorial and will attack any perceived threat to its territory.
>
> Research into Long Mary's anomalous properties is ongoing. It is currently unknown how the creature is able to maintain its snowy appearance year-round, as well as the potential use of its camouflage in other environments. Further study is required to fully understand the nature of this cryptid.

Wow! AI really delivered here, don't you think? Here's the original prompt I fed into the ChatGPT to generate this SCP entry:

> Imagine there is a cryptid that lives in the mountainous forests of northern Pennsylvania called Long Mary. It is a mammal that walks on four legs, and it has a snow-covered hump on its back. It has a long neck, along with a large head and a large mouth full of sharp teeth. When it crouches down, it looks like a snow drift with a post next to it. Please write an SCP entry about Long Mary. Feel free to embellish and make up new details about it.

## Parting Thoughts

Creating Long Mary was a wild ride. The inception through a series of random events, the iterative artistic process, and ultimately generating an SCP entry—each step was layered with learning. There's always room for improvement; the process can surely be optimized for efficiency. Regardless, I think we managed something unique here... almost as unique as a snow drift disguised as a camel.

I warmly invite your thoughts on Long Mary. Better yet, if you are inspired to invent your own cryptid, I'm intrigued to see your creations!

So, did our random roadside sighting lead us astray or on a rewarding detour? Would you stumble upon a cryptid the next time you see a strangely shaped snow drift? Well, truth be told, only time—and Google Maps' faster route—can tell.
